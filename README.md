## 📊 Key Metrics (DAX Measures)

### Financial Metrics
```dax
Total Spend = SUM(ROI[Spend_SAR])
Total Revenue = SUM(ROI[Revenue_SAR])
Net Profit = [Total Revenue] - [Total Spend]
Overall ROI % = ([Total Revenue] / [Total Spend] - 1) * 100
ROAS = [Total Revenue] / [Total Spend]
Profit Margin % = [Net Profit] / [Total Revenue] * 100
Average CPA = AVERAGE(ROI[CPA_SAR])
```

### Engagement Metrics
```dax
Total Impressions = SUM(Audience[Impressions])
Total Reach = SUM(Audience[Reach])
Avg CTR % = AVERAGE(Audience[CTR_%])
Engagement Rate % = AVERAGE(Engagement[Engagement_Rate_%])
Total Conversions = SUM(ROI[Conversions])
```
